	Drop RPM packaging. Documentation cleanups.

1.8: 2010-10-21T12:47:33Z

	map functions by Andrew Morrow. More on the history of the game.
	Enable arrow keys in edit mode.
	License changed from Chuck Simmons's cosmetically tweaked clone

	Cleanup release with new build machinery.

1.4: 2002-08-01T20:04:09Z
	Packaging tweaks.  RPM spec fixes.  READ.ME broken up into
	READ.ME and NEWS.  Obsolete bug notes removed.  Option -f to
	set savefile added.  I'd like to move the documentation to XML, 
	but can't yet because db2man doesn't render tables.

1.2: 2000-07-28T16:04:26Z
	The victory-odds table in previous versions was seriously buggy.
	I folded in corrections from Michael Self.  I also took changes
	from James T. Jordan <kermyt@earthling.net>, who wrote some
	speedups, added ANSI prototypes, and cleaned up code.

1.1: 1995-12-06T14:02:31
	Packaging tweaks.

1.0: 1994-12-01T17:15:43Z
	I colorized and speed-tuned this and added a
	save-interval option. 

The rest of this history is Chuck Simmons's original notes.  Because
there are so many other Empire games out there now (all descended from
this one!), I've reverted to the VMS Empire name.

History

	Apparently, this game was originally written outside of Digital,
	probably at a university.  The game was ported to DEC's VAX/VMS
	from the TOPS-10/20 FORTRAN sources available around fall 1979.
	Ed James got hold of the sources at Berkeley and converted
	portions of the code to C, mostly to use curses for the screen
	handling.  He published his modified sources on the net in
	December 1986.  Because this game ran on VMS machines for so
        long, a previous version is known as VMS Empire.

	In early 1987 I reverse engineered the program and wrote a
	version completely written in C.  In doing this, I used lots
	of structures and defined constants, and I attempted to make
	the code flexible and easy to modify.  The algorithms used
	in this C version are completely new, the names of the commands
	have been changed to be more mnemonic, and new commands have
	been implemented.  Only the format of the display is the same.
        I suspect that many of my changes are slower and less
        intelligently implemented than the originals.  Also, I have
	not implemented some of the original functionality.
	However, my hope is that the commented C sources I have written
	will prove far easier to modify and enhance than the original
        FORTRAN sources.  If you make changes for the better, by
        all means send Ed James and I a copy.

	The basic game has been heavily modified.  I've changed the
	types of objects built, modified the parameters on others,
	and added lots of new kinds of movement functions.  Read
	the man page for a complete description.

	The file 'bugs' contains lots of ideas for enhancements,
	and describes the bugs I haven't been able to find.

Final Notes

	Unfortunately, I have a rather powerful mainframe at my
	disposal which is somewhere between 10 and 40 times as
	fast as a 68020 based computer.  This means I can afford
	to use extremely inefficient algorithms.  I suspect that
	running this program on a smaller machine, such as a Sun
	workstation or Vax will not be overly rewarding.  In particular,
	the computer will take a very long time to move its pieces,
	and it may not be desirable to save the game after every move.
	(You mean your system doesn't write out 1/2 megabyte files in a
	few milliseconds?)  This second problem is easily fixed, but
	I don't yet have any good ideas for fixing the first problem.

	The size of a saved file can be easily tuned by reducing the
	LIST_SIZE constant in empire.h.  The only current simple tweak
	for making the computer move faster is to reduce the size
	of a map.

	The low-end PCs of 2002 are more powerful than Chuck's 1987 mainframe.
	Performance tuning isn't the issue it once was. :-)

	My changes enable color on machines with terminfo color support, for
	a dramatic improvement in appearance and readability of the display.
	Color support, if present, will be auto-detected at compilation time.

	They also implement and document a `save-interval' option, addressing
	one of the misfeatures noted in the bugs file.

	I've also tweaked the sources so they compile clean under GCC -- they
	assumed the older K&R model of forward reference, causing many warning
	references.

	Finally, I've sped up expand_perimeter by cutting down on the
	number of array references it has to compute. This eliminates several
	multiplies from the inner loop, and is a technique that could be
	applied much more widely in the code.  If efficiency matters that much
	to you, maybe you need to get outside more.
